## üí° About the Application

This application is a Recipe Sharing System built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) recipes.

### Features

1. **Recipe Management**: Users can create new recipes, view all recipes, view a specific recipe by its ID or name, update existing recipes, and delete recipes.
2. **Tag-based Search**: Users can search for recipes based on tags. This feature allows users to find all recipes that fall under a specific category, such as 'Vegetarian', 'Gluten-free', etc.
3. **Name-based Search**: Users can search for recipes by their names. This feature allows users to find a specific recipe quickly if they know its name.
4. **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling. If an error occurs, the application will return a helpful error message and, in development mode, a stack trace.

### Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple and efficient way to manage and search for recipes.

## ‚öô Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsmeYaz/recipe-sharing-api.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into the cloned repository directory and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the Server**: Now, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start, and you should see a message like <span style="color:green"><strong>Listening on http://localhost:8080...</strong></span> in your terminal.

4. **Test the Application**: You can now test the application by sending requests to <span style="color:green"><strong>http://localhost:8080/api/recipes</strong></span>. You can use a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests.
